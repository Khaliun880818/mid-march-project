Title: Random Music Player
Reflection: Through this project, I wanted to solve a small problem that I was facing while taking online classes. I like to listen to music when I'm studying, I concentrate more with music. However, everytime when I change my music or the playlist ends, I get distracted because I have to look at my phone to change the music. Thus, I wanted to make a website where I can just click once and it gives me music until I want it to stop. That was my original plan, but after trying all different kinds of codes, I got to choose between two playlists, but the interaction needed from the user is still only a click.
#The challenges I faced while working on this project was that I found it quite hard to use both javascript and p5 at the same time. As if I only use one, I wasn't able to get the result I wanted, but if I use both, visual wise the website wouldn't look like my original plan. Also, it was challenging to use the functions of javascript, like onclick, onmousemove, on p5. 
# These are the references for some of my code:
    p5.org/reference - 
push();
translate(windowWidth/2, windowHeight/2);
rotate(angle);
fill(c);
strokeWeight(1);
circle(0, 0, 500);
stroke('black');
strokeWeight(4);
 line(0, 0, 0, 250);
 pop();
    editor.p5s.org:
var r, b;
function setup() { 
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  r = color(255,0,0);
  b = color(0,0,255);
} 

function draw() { 
  var t = map(mouseX,0,width,0,1.0);
  var c = lerpColor(r,b,t);
  background(c);
}
